# PyGame-Project
This is a simpler equivalent of Cedar Logic made in PyGame for my first year's term 1 project

It relies on the images in this repository to run as well as a couple of modules that are imported at the top of 'Python_Assignment.py'

Feel free to use and play around with the project but ask me for permission to use it for anything other than personal use
